We have developed an android application   that will change the Aadhar address of the user who has changed his location  by shifting to some other place . This will make the whole process of andress verification of the user who has recently 

Our application will allow the user to update their aadhaar address to the new location they are living in by taking the consent of the landlord by using a verification code generated on the landlordâ€™s device and entering in on their end. The application will also allow the user to check the status of their pending and past address update applications and make requests for the address update again if the previous application has been rejected by the landlord. 

After the landlord approves the address of the user, the address will also be updated on the aadhaar card of the user who requested the update.
